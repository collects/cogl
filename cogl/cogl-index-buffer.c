 *
 * XXX: I think in the end it'll be that CoglIndices are to
 * CoglIndexBuffers as CoglAttributes are to CoglAttributeBuffers. I.e
 * a CoglIndexBuffer is a lite subclass of CoglBuffer that simply
 * implies that the buffer will later be bound as indices but doesn't
 * track more detailed meta data. CoglIndices build on a
 * CoglIndexBuffer and define the type and max_index_value for some
 * sub-range of a CoglIndexBuffer.
