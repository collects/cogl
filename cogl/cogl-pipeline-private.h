 * _cogl_pipeline_weak_copy:
 * @pipeline: A #CoglPipeline object
 * @callback: A callback to notify when your weak pipeline is destroyed
 * @user_data: Private data to pass to your given callback.
 *
 * Returns a weak copy of the given source @pipeline. Unlike a normal
 * copy no internal reference is taken on the source @pipeline and you
 * can expect that later modifications of the source pipeline (or in
 * fact any other pipeline) can result in the weak pipeline being
 * destroyed.
 *
 * To understand this better its good to know a bit about the internal
 * design of #CoglPipeline...
 *
 * Internally #CoglPipeline<!-- -->s are represented as a graph of
 * property diff's, where each node is a diff of properties that gets
 * applied on top of its parent. Copying a pipeline creates an empty
 * diff and a child->parent relationship between the empty diff and
 * the source @pipeline, parent.
 *
 * Because of this internal graph design a single #CoglPipeline may
 * indirectly depend on a chain of ancestors to fully define all of
 * its properties. Because a node depends on its ancestors it normally
 * owns a reference to its parent to stop it from being freed. Also if
 * you try to modify a pipeline with children we internally use a
 * copy-on-write mechanism to ensure that you don't indirectly change
 * the properties those children.
 *
 * Weak pipelines avoid the use of copy-on-write to preserve the
 * integrity of weak dependants and instead weak dependants are
 * simply destroyed allowing the parent to be modified directly. Also
 * because weak pipelines don't own a reference to their parent they
 * won't stop the source @pipeline from being freed when the user
 * releases their reference on it.
 *
 * Because weak pipelines don't own a reference on their parent they
 * are the recommended mechanism for creating derived pipelines that you
 * want to cache as a private property of the original pipeline
 * because they won't result in a circular dependency.
 *
 * An example use case:
 *
 * Consider for example you are implementing a custom primitive that is
 * not compatible with certain source pipelines. To handle this you
 * implement a validation stage that given an arbitrary pipeline as
 * input will create a derived pipeline that is suitable for drawing
 * your primitive.
 *
 * Because you don't want to have to repeat this validation every time
 * the same incompatible pipeline is given as input you want to cache
 * the result as a private property of the original pipeline. If the
 * derived pipeline were created using cogl_pipeline_copy that would
 * create a circular dependency so the original pipeline can never be
 * freed.
 *
 * If you instead create a weak copy you won't stop the original pipeline
 * from being freed if it's no longer needed, and you will instead simply
 * be notified that your weak pipeline has been destroyed.
 *
 * This is the recommended coding pattern for validating an input
 * pipeline and caching a derived result:
