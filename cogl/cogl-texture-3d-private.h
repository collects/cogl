 * @internal_format: the #CoglPixelFormat that will be used for storing

 *    premultiplied format similar to the format of the source data will
 *    be used. The default blending equations of Cogl expect premultiplied
 *    color data; the main use of passing a non-premultiplied format here
 *    is if you have non-premultiplied source data and are going to adjust
 *    the blend mode (see cogl_pipeline_set_blend()) or use the data for
 *    something other than straight blending.
 * @error: A GError return location.
 *
 * Creates a new 3D texture and initializes it with the images in
 * @bmp_handle. The images are assumed to be packed together after one
 * another in the increasing y axis. The height of individual image is
 * given as @height and the number of images is given in @depth. The
 * actual height of the bitmap can be larger than @height Ã— @depth. In
 * this case it assumes there is padding between the images.
 *
 * Return value: the newly created texture or %COGL_INVALID_HANDLE if
 *   there was an error.
